<h2 class="mt-5">About this website</h2>
<h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>
    It is an index for other practice projects.
    It will also be used for introducing my Github repositories.
    Currently it is a simply Laravel practice project, too.
    It may be rebuilt by React or Angular as it is a static website.
    On the other hand it is not a notebook. There is a blog for writing something.

<h4>Tools</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Larave 8</li>
    <li>Bootstrap 5</li>
    <li>VS Code</li>
</ul>
